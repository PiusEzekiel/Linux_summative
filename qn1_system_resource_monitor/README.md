# Qn1. System Resource Monitoring

## Overview

The **System Resource Monitoring** project provides a tool to monitor and log system performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network bandwidth (TX and RX) in real-time. It uses a combination of a C program to capture system metrics and a Python script with a C extension for efficient data visualization.

The project includes:
- A **C program** for monitoring CPU, memory, and network usage.
- A **Python script** to visualize the logged data in a graph.
- An **automation script** to compile, build, and run the programs seamlessly.

---

## Features

The system resource monitoring tool provides the following functionality:
1. Logs system performance metrics at 2-second intervals:
   - **CPU Usage (%):** Tracks the percentage of CPU utilized.
   - **Memory Usage (%):** Tracks the percentage of RAM used.
   - **Network Usage (KB):** Tracks data received (RX) and transmitted (TX).
2. Saves the metrics to a file (`usage.txt`) with timestamps.
3. Records all active processes to a file (`processes.txt`).
4. Visualizes the logged metrics in a graph:
   - Displays CPU, memory, RX, and TX trends.

## Requirements

To build and run the system resource monitoring project, ensure you have:
- **Python 3.x**: To run the scripts and visualize the metrics.
- **GCC**: GNU Compiler Collection to compile the C programs.
- **Setuptools**: For building the Python C extension.
- A Linux-based system (uses `/proc` for data gathering).

---

## Usage

1. **Run the Automation Script**:  
   Execute the `monitor_automation.sh` script to compile the C program, build the C extension, and run the monitoring and plotting:
   ```bash
   ./monitor_automation.sh
   ```

---

## How It Works

### Script Workflow
The `monitor_automation.sh` script automates the following steps:
1. **Check Required Files**:  
   Ensures all necessary files (`monitor.c`, `setup.py`, `plot_metrics.py`) are present.

2. **Clean Existing Build Directory**:  
   Removes any previous build files to avoid conflicts.

3. **Compile the C Program**:  
   Compiles `monitor.c` to create the `monitor` executable, which logs system metrics.

4. **Build the Python C Extension**:  
   Uses Pythonâ€™s `setuptools` to compile the C extension (`metrics_reader.c`).

5. **Run the Monitoring Program**:  
   Executes `monitor` to gather and log data in `usage.txt` and `processes.txt`.

6. **Visualize the Data**:  
   Executes `plot_metrics.py` to generate a graph from the logged data.

### File Structure
- `monitor.c`: The C implementation for monitoring CPU, memory, and network usage.
- `setup.py`: The Python setup script to build the C extension.
- `metrics_reader.c`: A C extension for efficient file reading and processing.
- `plot_metrics.py`: The Python script for plotting logged metrics as a graph.
- `monitor_automation.sh`: The automation script for building, running, and visualizing the project.
- `usage.txt`: The file where system metrics are logged.
- `processes.txt`: The file where active processes are recorded.

### **Graph**
The graph generated by `plot_metrics.py` displays:
- CPU usage over time.
- Memory usage over time.
- Network RX and TX trends in kilobytes.
